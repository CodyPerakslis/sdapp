# Current View Information

## Discovery View

The discovery view consists of two main components:  
* A list of songs  
* The playback buttons

The Song list is a List View that is empty until items are added to it. We
will add items in the logic as the api call retrieves what songs are nearby.
It takes up 7/8 of the available screen.

We need to test adding items to see what it looks like to adjust that aspect
of this interface.

The playback buttons are
* Save song
* Go back
* Play / Pause
* Skip Forward
* Up-vote

For the time being the layout is nicer without a down-vote button.
We will want the buttons to be icons when we find some to use.
